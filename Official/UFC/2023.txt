The Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) were established to govern professional MMA competitions and ensure consistent rules across different regulatory bodies. These rules cover judging criteria, fouls, prohibited substances, number of rounds and their duration, weight classes, medical requirements, and athlete attire and equipment.

The UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) has embraced and adopted the Unified Rules of MMA since 2000, prioritizing athlete safety and fair competition. All UFC bouts strictly follow these rules. The UFC also exceeds the prohibited substances requirements through their comprehensive UFC Anti-Doping Policy.

The rules outline various acts that are considered fouls in MMA, such as headbutting, eye gouging, biting, fish hooking, strikes to certain areas, groin attacks, holding the fence, and unsportsmanlike conduct. Referees have the discretion to penalize fighters for committing fouls.

Disqualification can occur after a combination of fouls or a flagrant foul as determined by the referee. Point deductions may also be given for fouls, and only the referee can assess and penalize fouls.

Judges are strictly responsible for scoring the fight based on the effectiveness of strikes, grappling, control, aggression, and overall performance. They should not assess fouls themselves unless the referee calls them. If a foul is not called by the referee, the judges should not factor it into their scoring calculations.

Additional rules include:

- Grabbing the ropes or fence with fingers or toes is prohibited.
- Small joint manipulation, such as targeting and manipulating fingers or toes of the opponent, is not allowed.
- Throwing the opponent out of the ring or fighting area is a foul.
- Intentionally inserting a finger into any orifice or cut of an opponent is prohibited.
- Clawing, pinching, or twisting the flesh of the opponent is not allowed.
- Timidity, which involves avoiding contact, consistently dropping the mouthpiece, or faking an injury, may result in penalties.
- Using abusive language in the fighting area is prohibited.
- Flagrant disregard for the referee's instructions or unsportsmanlike conduct causing injury to an opponent can result in penalties.
- Attacking an opponent after the bell or during the break is considered a foul.
- Interference from a fighter's corner or seconds is not allowed.

In the case of fouls, a referee may disqualify a fighter after any combination of fouls or a flagrant foul. Points can be deducted by the official scorekeeper from the offending contestant's score. The scorekeeper calculates the true score after factoring in the point deduction.

It is essential to note that judges should not consider fouls in their scoring unless they are called by the referee. Their focus should be on assessing the effectiveness of strikes, grappling, control, aggression, and overall performance to determine the winner of the bout.

These rules and regulations serve to maintain the integrity of the sport, protect the safety of the fighters, and ensure fair competition. The UFC, as the leading organization in MMA, works closely with athletic commissions to update and improve the Unified Rules of MMA in line with the evolving landscape of the sport.

By adhering to these rules, officials can provide a structured and regulated environment for fighters to showcase their skills and determination, thrilling fans around the world with the exciting and dynamic sport of mixed martial arts.


OVERVIEW:

The Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) aim to provide a clear set of rules governing professional MMA competition that remain consistent across the jurisdictions of various athletic commissions and other regulatory bodies. The framework of the Unified Rules of MMA was proposed and agreed upon by various athletic commissions in the 2000s and unanimously adopted by the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) on July 30, 2009.
