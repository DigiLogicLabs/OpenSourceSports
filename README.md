A collaborative platform for open-source rule sets for all types of sports and competitions, tracked and managed through GitHub.

### About OSS

OSS is built on the concept of open collaboration and transparency in the world of sports. By leveraging the version control capabilities of GitHub, we aim to offer a dynamic and continuously evolving repository of sports rules and regulations. Our mission is to foster a community-driven environment where sports enthusiasts, organizations, and casual players alike can contribute to and access an up-to-date compendium of sports rules.

**Official Sports**: These are professional, organized sports with established rules governed by recognized bodies such as FIFA, NBA, UFC, NFL, and NHL. OSS is a repository for these official rule sets, providing a platform for their dissemination, discussion, and potential refinement.

**Custom Sports**: Representing the grassroots of sport, custom sports are those created by individuals or communities, often with unique and innovative rules. OSS is an inclusive space to document and share these rules, encouraging creativity and participation across all levels of play.

### Website

Our vision extends beyond GitHub with the development of opensourcesports.io â€“ a platform aiming to feature these rule sets in a user-friendly format. This will include:

- :hammer_and_wrench: Tooling for easy access, comparison, and discussion of rules.
- :world_map: Interactive platforms for sharing experiences and best practices.
- :trophy: A dedicated area for emerging sports to gain exposure and community feedback.

### Community Building

Join us in creating a comprehensive and diverse collection of sports rules:

- :seedling: Contribute to our growing library of rules for both official and custom sports.
- :busts_in_silhouette: Engage with a global community of sports enthusiasts.
- :writing_hand: Help refine and propose enhancements to existing rule sets.

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain a high standard and clear organization, we ask contributors to follow these guidelines:

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use clear and descriptive names for folders and files.
   - For **official sports**, name folders after the sport, followed by the governing body if applicable (e.g., `Soccer/FIFA`).
   - Rule files should include the year or version in the title (e.g., `Rules_2024.md` or `v1.0.0.md`).

2. **Folder Structure**:
   - Official sports should be placed within the `Official` folder, with subfolders representing each sport.
   - Custom sports rules belong in the `Custom` folder, categorized by play type (e.g., `Casual`, `Competitive`).

3. **Language and Localization**:
   - Start with English and add translations as subfolders within each sport's directory.
   - Please name translation folders by their ISO language code (e.g., `Soccer/FIFA/en`, `Soccer/FIFA/es` for Spanish).

4. **Pull Requests**:
   - Ensure all proposed changes or additions are submitted via pull requests for review.
   - Provide a clear and detailed explanation of your contributions.

5. **Code of Conduct**:
   - All interactions within the OSS community should adhere to our Code of Conduct, fostering respect and inclusivity.

We appreciate your interest and contributions to OSS, where every rule is a chance to play fair and have fun. Let's build the most extensive open-source sports rule book together!
