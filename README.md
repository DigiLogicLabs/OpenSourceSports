Official OSS rules for various sports

---

### About OSS :
> The idea of OSS is to create open source rule sets for all different types of sports and competitions.
We use GitHub to track open source rules, and are committed to continuously innovating and improving our services. 
Our goal is to provide a collaborative and inclusive environment that encourages everyone to contribute to and share the best rules for their sports.


Official sports in OSS are those that are represented by larger organizations such as the UFC, NFL, NHL, NBA, and more. 
These sports have established and widely recognized rulesets that are followed by professional athletes and teams. 
OSS serves as a platform to collaborate and improve upon these existing rules, ensuring their accessibility and relevance to all participants. 

Custom sports, on the other hand, are represented by individuals or groups that have created their own unique games and rulesets. 
OSS welcomes and embraces these custom sports, providing a space for individuals and groups to share and contribute to the best rules for their own creations. 
This inclusive approach allows for a diverse range of sports to be recognized and enjoyed by a wider audience.
