      <h2>Section 3: Playing Area</h2>
      <p>The game can be played in various environments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Indoor:</strong> A house, building, or defined indoor space with multiple hiding spots</li>
        <li><strong>Outdoor:</strong> A yard, park, playground, or other outdoor area with natural hiding places</li>
        <li>Clear boundaries should be established before play begins</li>
        <li>A designated "home base" or "safe zone" is required (often a tree, pole, wall, or other landmark)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Safety considerations for the playing area:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Area should be free of dangerous hazards</li>
        <li>Boundaries should keep players within safe, supervised areas</li>
        <li>Off-limits areas should be clearly defined (e.g., roads, water features, private property)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="players-officials">
      <h2>Section 4: Players/Officials</h2>
      <p>Hide and Seek is flexible in terms of participants:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum: 2 players (1 seeker, 1 hider)</li>
        <li>Optimal: 4-10 players</li>
        <li>No officials required; players self-regulate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Player roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seeker:</strong> Counts to a predetermined number while others hide, then searches for hidden players</li>
        <li><strong>Hiders:</strong> Find hiding spots while the seeker counts, attempting to remain undiscovered</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Section 5: Rules of Play</h2>
      <h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>One player is designated as the "seeker" (often through a selection method like drawing straws, counting out, or volunteering)</li>
        <li>The seeker closes their eyes or faces a wall at the designated home base and counts aloud to a predetermined number (typically 20-100, depending on the size of the playing area)</li>
        <li>While counting, other players hide within the established boundaries</li>
        <li>After counting, the seeker calls out "Ready or not, here I come!" and begins searching for hidden players</li>
        <li>When the seeker finds a hidden player, that player is "caught" and joins the seeker at home base</li>
        <li>The game continues until all players are found or a time limit is reached</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Variations</h3>
      <h4>Traditional Hide and Seek</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>First player found becomes the seeker in the next round</li>
        <li>Last player found wins the round and earns the right to hide in the next round</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Sardines</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>One player hides while all others count</li>
        <li>Seekers search individually</li>
        <li>When a seeker finds the hidden player, they quietly join them in the hiding spot</li>
        <li>Game continues until all players are hiding together in the same spot</li>
        <li>Last player to find the group becomes the hider in the next round</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Home Base Hide and Seek</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Hidden players can "free" themselves by running to home base without being tagged by the seeker</li>
        <li>Seeker must tag players before they reach home base</li>
        <li>First player caught becomes the next seeker</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="scoring">
      <h2>Section 6: Scoring</h2>
      <p>Hide and Seek typically doesn't use a formal scoring system, but common victory conditions include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Last player found wins the round</li>
        <li>Players who reach home base without being caught win the round</li>
        <li>For competitive play, points can be awarded based on:
          <ul>
            <li>Time hidden without being found</li>
            <li>Successfully reaching home base</li>
            <li>Finding all hidden players quickly (for seekers)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
