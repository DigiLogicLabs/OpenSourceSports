Japanese Version
A version of hide and seek is promoted by Professor Hazaki of Nippon Sport Science University, a member of Hide-and-Seek Promotion Committee of Japan. 
In this game, two teams battle it out on a fixed size pitch, preferably in woodlands. Two teams of seven players against each other in a 10-minute match. 
In the first five-minute half, one team is given two minutes to hide on a “pitch” that measures 65ft x 65ft . The opposing team then has to locate and touch the hiding players. 
In the version for children under the age of 12, the pitch measures 55 feet x 88 feet. There is a push for hide and seek to be included in the 2020 Olympic Games program.


Italian Version
There is also another major hide-and-seek competition, the Nascondino World Championship. 
Nascondino means "hide and seek" in Italian. Although it is described as the world championships, so far only Italian teams have entered. 
The competition was first held in 2010 in Bergamo, Italy, as an initiative of CTRL Magazine, a local publication. In the first year, 15 teams participated. 
It has gradually built up and in 2016, 64 teams of five members each entered the competition. The rules are enforced by two referees and a game coordinator. 
The teams are divided in four groups, and one person per group hides while a "neutral searching team" counts to 60. 
Participants then have 10 minutes to jump out of their hiding spot and hit a target in the middle of the playing field, without being found or caught by the searching team. 
The competition continues for two days until a winner is declared.
